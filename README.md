# Anomaly Detection in Yeast Dataset

This is a project for the Machine Learning 2 course at EPITA. The goal is to detect anomalies in the yeast dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains information about yeast cells. The dataset is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/yeast

## Model Comparison Plan
We evaluate five multivariate models to identify the best performer for the Yeast dataset's specific topography:

* **Isolation Forest:** 
* **Mahalanobis Distance:** 
* **Local Outlier Factor (LOF):** 
* **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):**
* **One-Class SVM:**
